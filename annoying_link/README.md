## The URL Builder

The URL Builder is a powerful tool hidden in the page for creating your own Annoying Link with ease.

To access the URL Builder, go to the tool's page and click the "i" button at the bottom left corner.
This will open up a credit footer. On the right side of it, you will find a button called "URL Builder", click it to open up the URL Builder window.

**Tip:** The URL Builder window is draggable and resizable.

### Using the URL Builder

Here are the entries, and what they should contain:
- URL - The destination URL of the link
- Display Text - The text to display in the link instead of the URL
- Annoyance Level - The amount of time the user has to click the link in order to reach the destination
- Inital Phrase - The first phrase displayed above the link
- Phrases - The randomly picked phrases to display when the user clicks the link

**Tip:** Click "+ Add Phrase" to add another phrase entry.

**Note:** The first phrase entry (not the inital phrase) is hard coded to display first when the user clicks the link.

Once all filled out appropriately, press the "Build" button.
The built URL will be shown in the large text box, click on it to copy to clipboard.
